# Smart Contract Security: The 10 Most Common Exploits

Smart contracts have revolutionized the way we think about decentralized agreements. However, their immutable nature means that bugs can be catastrophic.

## 1. Reentrancy

Reentrancy is perhaps the most famous vulnerability in smart contracts, most notably causing the DAO hack.

```solidity
// Vulnerable Code
function withdraw() public {
    uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success);
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;
}
```

### Prevention
Always follow the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern.

```solidity
// Secure Code
function withdraw() public {
    uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
    balances[msg.sender] = 0; // Update state before interaction
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success);
}
```

## 2. Integer Overflow and Underflow

Prior to Solidity 0.8.0, integers could overflow or underflow without error.

## 3. Front-running

Front-running occurs when an attacker sees a transaction in the mempool and submits their own transaction with a higher gas price.
