# Scaling Backend Systems with Event-Driven Architecture

Modern applications require systems that can scale horizontally and handle failures gracefully.

## The Shift from Monoliths to Microservices

Event-driven architecture (EDA) allows services to communicate asynchronously via events, reducing coupling and increasing fault tolerance.

## Kafka for Event Streaming

Kafka acts as the central nervous system of an event-driven setup.

```yaml
# Simple Kafka Producer Config
bootstrap.servers: localhost:9092
key.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
value.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
```

## Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)

Handling failures is critical. Use DLQs to capture failed events for later inspection and reprocessing.
