# Building Low-Latency Trading Systems in Modern C++

In the world of quantitative trading, microseconds are the difference between profit and loss.

## Kernel Bypass Techniques

To achieve ultra-low latency, we often need to bypass the standard Linux networking stack. Technologies like **Solarflare's Onload** or **DPDK** are essential.

## Lock-Free Programming

Avoid mutexes at all costs in the hot path. Use atomic operations and lock-free queues for inter-thread communication.

```cpp
#include <atomic>

template<typename T>
class LockFreeQueue {
    // Implementation of a single-producer single-consumer queue
};
```

## CPU Pinning & Isolation

Isolating cores and pinning threads to specific CPUs can drastically reduce cache misses and context switch overhead.
