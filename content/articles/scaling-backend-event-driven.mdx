# Event-Driven Scalability in Fintech: From Technex to Brite Payments

In the fintech space, scalability isn't just about handling more users—it's about processing high-value transactions with sub-second latency and absolute reliability. My experience at **Technex** and **Brite Payments** centered on building these high-performance, event-driven backends.

## The Fintech Challenge: PSD2 & Real-Time Transfers

Integrating with PSD2-compliant APIs requires managing complex authentication flows and ensuring that real-time bank transfers are processed without interruption. This is where event-driven architecture (EDA) proves its worth.

### Decoupling for Resilience

By using an event-driven approach, we decoupled the sensitive bank communication layers from the core transaction processing. This ensured that if a bank's API went down, the rest of the system remained functional and could retry the transaction once the connection was restored.

```typescript
// Example Event-Driven Transfer Initiation
async function initiateTransfer(transferData: TransferRequest) {
    try {
        // Validation and internal state update
        const transfer = await db.createTransfer(transferData);
        
        // Publish event for processing
        await eventBus.publish('TRANSFER_INITIATED', {
            id: transfer.id,
            amount: transfer.amount,
            destination: transfer.iban
        });
        
        return { status: 'PENDING', reference: transfer.id };
    } catch (error) {
        log.error('Failed to initiate transfer', error);
        throw new FintechError('INITIALIZATION_FAILED');
    }
}
```

## Scaling with Microservices

At Technex, we focused on building modular microservices that could scale independently. This allowed us to allocate more resources to the high-traffic API nodes while keeping the background reconciliation services lean.

> [!TIP]
> Use idempotent event handlers to ensure that processing the same event multiple times doesn't lead to duplicate transactions—a critical requirement in fintech.

### Key Performance Metrics:
- **Throughput**: Scaled to handle thousands of concurrent API requests.
- **Latency**: Sub-200ms processing for internal ledger updates.
- **Reliability**: Implemented robust Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for transaction auditing and recovery.

The transition to a fully event-driven model allowed us to support the rapid growth of Brite Payments' real-time account-to-account payment infrastructure.
