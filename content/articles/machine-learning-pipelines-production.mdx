# Machine Learning Pipelines: From Research to Production

Bridging the gap between a notebook and a production API is one of the biggest challenges in AI engineering.

## Data Versioning with DVC

Never lose track of which data produced which model.

```bash
dvc add data/training_set.csv
git add data/training_set.csv.dvc .gitignore
git commit -m "Add raw training data"
```

## Feature Stores

Standardize feature engineering across training and inference.

## Monitoring Drift

Implement monitoring for both feature drift and concept drift to ensure your model remains accurate over time.
